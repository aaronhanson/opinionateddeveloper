We've Got Opinions
====================
Test test.

Working with smart people is in my opinion the single
fastest way to improve as a developer.  

Smart people tend to engage in intelligent debate, 
and if you're in earshot, you'll find that you get to absorb a 
lot of wisdom just by listening to these.

I work with smart people who take these debates to epic
levels.  This blog is a tribute to those debates, the 
opinions expressed and the people who express them.

It's also an excuse to write a small blogging platform in node
that will be contributed to by others using the pull request process.

Enjoy.
