[Try Everything](#/post/try)
====================

Years ago when I was in middle school and high school, all of the best athletes were in lots of sports.  Using the both the physical and mental skills learned in one, to improve another.  Today, however, it seems that specializing has become the trend.  Pick a sport early.  Focus entirely on it.  Have all of your hopes and dreams crushed when you don't get that Division 1 scholarship, having never given yourself the chance to discover a hidden talent or lifelong passion.

Young programmers today I think are falling into this trend as well.  Picking a language or framework and discounting everything else.  As an old school hacker, I think that is probably the single fastest way for your learning to stagnant.

Try Everything.
