Opinionated Developer
====================

[OpinionatedDeveloper.com](http://www.opinionateddeveloper.com) is a blog dedicated to the argumentitive types that 
I work with.

To create a new post, simply clone the repo.  Run "rake post['onewordpostname']" and a new markdown file with the proper name and date information will be created for you.

This will also create a scaffolded post for you, with permalink included.

When your ready to post it to the site, just do a pull request.  Simple as that.

Enjoy.
